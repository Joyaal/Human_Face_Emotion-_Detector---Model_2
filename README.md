- Dataset for training and validation from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/juniorbueno/rating-opencv-emotion-images
- ML Model program file
- GUI program file
- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml
- model.weights.h5
- model_a.json You may need to keep all these files in a single directory.

Steps:
1. Download all files and arrange within a single directory in your system. (Also extract the dataset before use)
2. Open the ML Model program file.
   - In this program, set the training dataset and validation/testing dataset path as it is present in your system.
   - Run your program.
3. Open the GUI program file.
   - Keep in mind to type the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml, model_a.json, model.weights.h5 files name as it is present in your directory.
